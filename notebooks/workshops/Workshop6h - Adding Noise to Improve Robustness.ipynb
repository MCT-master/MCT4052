    "# MCT4052 Workshop 6h: Adding Noise to Improve Robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "*Author: Stefano Fasciani, stefano.fasciani@imv.uio.no, Department of Musicology, University of Oslo.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a small dataset overfitting is likely to happen. Noise can help the ML model to learn a better generalization of the data and therefore avoid overfitting and improve the accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something we have to do \"manually\", and therefore it's essential to have all aspects of the training \n",
    "process under control. In this example we double the size of the training set by adding gaussian noise (zero mean, arbitrary variance) to the existing examples. At first we do this on a single split, and then we repeat the same on a repeated stratified k fold manually (but we have to do it manually). The variance is a parameter we have to tune. If features are scaled (normailzed) a 0.1 variance can represent 10% of the variance of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fairly simple on classification problem, as we create new examples adding a bit of noise to the features and keeping the same label. On regression problem this is a little more complex, as we also need to create new target values (we can use a previously trained model as in this [tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/test-time-augmentation-with-scikit-learn/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it will be better to add noise direcly into the model (e.g. inside the ANN) but with scikit-learn this is not possible. To achieve a better or equivalent result we sould perform the trainign semi-manually using partial_fit() and changing the noise in in the features at each training iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to add noise directly into the the raw-data before comuting the features, which usually help to improve the robustness against noise of the ML-based system.\n",

    "Mind that although we fixed the random split initializing the random_state to a fixed integer, the results (accuracy) will change at every execution. In particular, the weights of the ANN are initialized randomly, therefore reteaining again the ANN on the same dataset (non extended) may produce different results. At times the random initialization of weights may be more favorable to the task, other time less favorable. Moreover, when extendin the training set we add noise which is random by nature, and therefore also this will be at times favorable to the classification tasks, and at time adverse (as we will see in the next section, on average over a long run it should be favorable).\n"
