    "# MCT4052 Workshop 7b: Posture Mapping to Real Valued Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*Author: Stefano Fasciani, stefano.fasciani@imv.uio.no, Department of Musicology, University of Oslo.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the same data (and postures) presented in Workshop 5a, but here we train a regressor instead of a classifier. In particular we selected a MLP regressor that output two real-valued quantities with the range [0,1] which we can later use to control any music-related continuous value parameter (for example we can further forward them via OSC). With an MLP regressor we can chose to hany any number of output real-valued parameters (if too many with few input features, these may result highly correlated and poorly independently controllable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this notebook is similar to Workshop 5a, but instead of creating a labels we create a bidimensional array of arbitrary target values for the controld signals (associated with the postures). These are meant to be learned by the regressor. Note that the data not associated with the four postures is discarded as is not needed (there is no 'other' in this context). The regressor will 'decide' how to interpolate across postures (and associated output values) then at the input there is data that does not belong to any of the four postures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of sysem output there s a major difference as the regressor is capable to interpolate the output values across the postures, and therefore we achieve continuous control of parameters through gestures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also this example requires [oscHook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hollyhook.oscHook&hl=en&gl=US) on Android, and for back compatibility reasons, in the oscHook v2 application we have set 'Data range' and 'Output range' to [-10;10] for both accelerometer and linear acceleration. If you are using oscHook v1 you have to rename 'accelerometer' to 'gravity' in the OSC prefix of the third cell of this notebook."
